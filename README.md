# **TODO APP** | [LINK](https://olgagrishchenko.github.io/todo-app/)

***
    TODO application created with HTML | CSS | JavaScript
***

ðŸ‘‰ I created the app which allows to input a todo that gets included into the todo-list and saved on the page. You may delete a todo or click "completed".

ðŸ‘‰ I`ve worked with LocalStorage so that all todos remain saved on the page after page refresh.

ðŸ‘‰ You can enter a task using the "Add" button or using the Enter key.
